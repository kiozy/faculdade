						  <p class="texter">Shaking his head in bewilderment, Richard stepped back and did as he was asked. From inside the large untidy room he listened to the sound of the Professor's tread mounting the stairs one at a time.</p>
						  <p class="texter">He mounted them with a heavy deliberation, like the ticking of a great, slow clock.</p>
						  <p class="texter">Richard heard him reach the top landing. There he paused in silence. Seconds went by, five, maybe ten, maybe twenty. Then came again the heavy movement and breath that had first so harrowed the Professor.</p>
						  <p class="texter">Richard moved quickly to the door but did not open it. The chill of the room oppressed and disturbed him. He shook his head to try and shake off the feeling, and then held his breath as the footsteps started once again slowly to traverse the two yards of the landing and to pause there again.</p>
						  <p class="texter">After only a few seconds; this time Richard heard the long slow squeak of a door being opened inch by inch, inch by cautious inch, until it must surely now at last be standing wide agape.</p>
						  <p class="texter">Nothing further seemed to happen for a long, long time. Then at last the door closed once again, slowly. The footsteps crossed the landing and paused again.</p>
						  <p class="texter">Richard backed a few slight paces from the door, staring fixedly at it. Once more the footsteps started to descend the stairs; slowly, deliberately and quietly, until at last they reached the bottom. Then after a few seconds more the door handle began to rotate. The door opened and Reg walked calmly in.</p>
						  <p class="texter">"It's all right, it's just a horse in the bathroom," he said quietly.</p>

							<p class="texter">That had been the thing which had shaken out of him the lingering shred of warmth at the back of his mind which said that this was just a temporary problem. It seemed terrible in the night hours, but would be all right in the morning when he could see people and sort things out.</p>
							<p class="texter">He fingered the memory of the moment in his mind and could not let it go. He had seen Richard and Richard, he knew, had seen him. It was not going to be all right. Usually when he felt this bad at night he popped downstairs to see what was in the fridge, so he went now. It would be more cheerful than this moonlit bedroom. He would hang around the kitchen going bump in the night.</p>
							 <p class="texter">He slid down - and partially through - the banisters, wafted through the kitchen door without a second thought and then devoted all his concentration and energy for about five minutes to getting the light switch on.</p>
